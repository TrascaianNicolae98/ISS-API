# Presentation of the project requirements

To put it shortly, the task was to create an application that supports the creation and management of an academic conference, on which different users (committee members, chairs, authors) could login/ register and join the conference. <br>
A PC Member could review papers submitted by authors, the chair was in charge of resolving conflicts, inviting new members, organizing the conference a.s.o. <br>
A person who would just want to participate could buy a ticket for the session(s) he prefers without having to create an account.
